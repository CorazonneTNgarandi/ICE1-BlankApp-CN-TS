# ICE1-BlankApp-CN-TS
FIRST Blank App
This is my first React Native Expo project using TypeScript for Mobile App Scripting.

## Setup Steps I Followed
 Installed Node.js and npm
 Installed Expo CLI using  `npx create-expo-app`
 Used the `blank-typescript` template
 Opened the app with `npx expo start` and scanned the QR code using Expo Go on iPhone
Edited `App.tsx` to display: `Hello, [Your Name]!`

The hardest part was setting up Expo CLI due to Node version issues. I fixed it by using the recommended `npx` commands instead of the global CLI.
